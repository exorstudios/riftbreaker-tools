1. Copy `io_scene_mesh` to "%BLENDER_LOCATION%/scripts/addons ( ex. E:\Programy\Blender\2.81\scripts\addons_contrib )
2. Enable addon in Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Testing > Export: EXOR mesh format
3. In menu File > Export should be new entry: EXOR Mesh ( .mesh )
4. When exporting you will see untitled.fbx as export name, you can leave it as is because Add-on will export all your objects on scene as separate meshes named as: <object_name>.mesh
